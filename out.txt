Reading tracefile: malloc-traces/binary.rep
Checking mm_malloc for correctness, efficiency, and performance.

Results for mm malloc:
trace  valid  util     ops      secs  Kops
 0       yes   51%    8000  0.027822   288
Total          51%    8000  0.027822   288

Perf index = 31 (util) + 12 (thru) = 42/100
